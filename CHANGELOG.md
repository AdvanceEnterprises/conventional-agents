## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- JavaScript/TypeScript guidelines: `JS_STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `JS_TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `JS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` under `guidelines/javascript/` (FS-0014, PLAN-0006).
- Versioning, releases, and packaging workflow: `workflows/versioning-and-releases.md` — covers semver by project type, changelog conventions, agent-safe vs human-gated actions, dependency and submodule versioning (FS-0015, PLAN-0007).
- BDD/TDD pre-commit testing gate in `guidelines/ROLE_CONTRACT.md` — agents must run tests before committing, must not commit with failing tests.
- Versioning constraints in `guidelines/ROLE_CONTRACT.md` — agents must not bump major versions or publish without human approval; version bumps are release-prep only.
- Version-number discipline in all three implementation guides (Bash, Python, JS/TS) — do not change version numbers during feature work.
- Exported surface vs internal governance split documented in `README.md`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) with retroactive entries.
- `agentic-bootstrap-constitution` template repo created as the recommended project starter.

### Changed

- Project renamed from `agent-dev-kit` to `agentic-dev-kit` (repo: `Tais-Den/agentic-dev-kit`). Vendored mount path remains `vendor/agent-dev-kit/` for backward compatibility.
- `docs/workflows/` moved to `workflows/` (exported surface, not internal docs).
- CI workflow file renamed from `lint-adrs.yml` to `lint-docs.yml`; now lints ADRs, specs, change plans, and workflows.
- `package.json` lint scripts updated: added `lint:specs`, `lint:plans`, `lint:workflows`, `lint:docs`; scripts use `npx` for local execution.
- README submodule/clone URLs updated to `Tais-Den/agentic-dev-kit`; default branch reference changed to `trunk`.

### Fixed

- ADR-0004 precedence wording corrected (was "highest-numbered wins", now "lowest-numbered/highest-priority wins").
- `INTEGRATION.md` directory tree corrected (showed `agentic-dev-kit/` instead of `agent-dev-kit/` for vendored path).

### Added

- Initial framework release.
- Bash guidelines: `BASH_STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `BASH_TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `BASH_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.

- ADRs 0000–0011 establishing framework decisions.
